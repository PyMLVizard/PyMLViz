    "\n",
    "Vanilla gradient descent slows down to a crawl if the gradient becomes very flat. This can for example be observed on the elliptic normal example. As soon as the elongated vallee is reached, progress along it becomes very slow. Increasing the learning rate helps to some extend, but leads to oscillations of increasing amplitude. The problem being that the gradient and curvature in different directions is of different magnitude. While the learning rate has to be set such that steps are not too large in the steeper/more curved direction thereby slowing the speed of convergence along the shallower direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many variants of gradient descent try to remedy this problem by adjusting the gradient steps or learning rate. Here, we will illustrate several well-known methods. Even though we don't prove it here, all these methods are also suitable for stochastic gradient descent."

    "Currently, Adam and RMSprop appear to provide a good compromise between robustness -- wrt to the choice of parameters -- and speed of convergence. Both methods are often used in practical applications. Especially, in high-dimensional problems large differences between algorithms can be observed. In this case, many models exhibit loss functions with saddle points. At these points gradients vanish even though they are not local minima, i.e. there are directions along hich the loss increases, as well as directions along which it decreases. A good algorithm should be quickly able to identify the decreasing directions without slowing down due to shallow gradients close to the saddle. \n",
